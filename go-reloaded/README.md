## Text Completion & Editing Tool

### Introduction  
A lightweight text editing and auto‑correction tool written in **Go**.  
It reads an input file, applies transformations, and writes the corrected text to an output file.  

---

### Objectives  
- Read text from a file  
- Apply rule‑based transformations  
- Output corrected text  
- Ensure proper punctuation/grammar  
- Validate with unit tests  

---

### Features  
1. **Number Conversion**  
   - `<word> (hex)` → decimal  
   - `<word> (bin)` → decimal  

2. **Case Transformations**  
   - `(up)` → uppercase  
   - `(low)` → lowercase  
   - `(cap)` → capitalize  
   - Supports counts: `(up,2)`  

3. **Punctuation & Quotes**  
   - Attach punctuation correctly  
   - Fix grouped marks (`...`, `!?`)  
   - Remove spaces inside quotes  

4. **Article Correction**  
   - `a` → `an` before vowels or `h`
